description: Collection of our previously held contests and their problems
layout: page
---

<p>
	On this page, you can see the questions and contest pages from the past <em>Code Hackathon</em> weeks and now, the <em>Rookie Hour</em> challenges. We encourage you to read through the problem sets and practice.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Starting with <em>Code Hackathon Week 3</em>, we will not be publishing solutions for our questions. We believe that trying to solve a question on your own is the best way to learn &amp; improve. The sense of satisfaction that we gain on successfully solving a question and all of its hidden test cases is something that keeps us going. This kind of tenacity is what interviewers look for in freshers: persistence, self-reliance, hard-work, and above all, patience. So pick a time that suits you &amp; stick to it. Practice, practice, practice!
